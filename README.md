HealthCheck
=======

HealthCheck is a framework  which is capable of executing a defined set of tasks. Each task is defined to check the availability of a specific resource. An example of resource availability could be a database server being up and ready for queries, mail server readiness and ability for sending emails, or even a file-sharing server being available to file uploads. It might also be a web site returning a 200 HTTP status code.
